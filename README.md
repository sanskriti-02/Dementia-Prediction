# Predicting the Likelihood of Dementia and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease in Senior Citizens

Alzheimer's disease and dementia present formidable challenges to healthcare systems globally, necessitating early detection for effective intervention and improved patient outcomes. This study conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of machine learning and deep learning models for the detection of these debilitating neurodegenerative conditions, utilizing the OASIS Longitudinal dataset for the same. Through meticulous preprocessing and a custom iterative feature selection technique, various machine learning algorithms, including XG Boost, Random Forest, Extra Trees, Nearest Centroid, Histogram Gradient Boosting, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and a Sequential deep learning model, are rigorously evaluated.

In addition to individual model assessment, an optimized ensemble learning approach employing a hard voting classifier is proposed, achieving an outstanding 95.75% accuracy in dementia detection. Furthermore, the deep learning model demonstrates considerable efficacy, achieving a validation accuracy of 94.68%. These findings highlight the immense potential of machine learning and deep learning in revolutionizing early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning for Alzheimer's disease and dementia. The proposed ensemble learning method exhibits substantial improvement over individual classifiers, offering a promising avenue for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and advancing patient care in clinical settings.

By surpassing existing approaches and industry standards, this study demonstrates the importance of meticulous preprocessing and feature selection in optimizing model performance. These results highlight the potential of machine learning and deep learning techniques to revolutionize diagnostic practices, ultimately contributing to improved patient care and management strategies for Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Future research directions may explore the integration of diverse datasets and validation in real-world clinical settings to further enhance the efficacy and generalizability of these models.
